# Meta (about the docs site)

This documentation site lands a bit outside the broader design of this process.
It would probably make more sense to use a Rust-based documentation site
builder, as well as including `rustdoc` output to generate granular
documentation from the source code of each project, and then host that as part
of the documentation website.
