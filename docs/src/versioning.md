# Versioning

Throughout the codebase, versions are derived from git tags of the whole repo.
In a more professional context, items in this monorepo (web frontend, backend,
and mobile app) would each be individually versioned and separate releasable,
so this approach isn't ideal in that way, but it does keep things simple.
